All data being used are generated(fake).\n\nAn Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online is at a fork in the road. Although, it is an online clothing store, they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.\n\n\nThe company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We'll explore the data and apply linear regression technique to provide the company with the insights to better their decision process"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports\n\nLet's make the necessary imports"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Read the data\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cust_data = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-ecommerce-customers/Ecommerce Customers')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The csv has Customer info, such as Email, Address, and their color Avatar.
